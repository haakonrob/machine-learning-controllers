abstract = {A common belief in model-free reinforcement learning is that methods based on random search in the parameter space of policies exhibit significantly worse sample complexity than those that explore the space of actions. We dispel such beliefs by introducing a random search method for training static, linear policies for continuous control problems, matching state-of-the-art sample efficiency on the benchmark MuJoCo locomotion tasks. Our method also finds a nearly optimal controller for a challenging instance of the Linear Quadratic Regulator, a classical problem in control theory, when the dynamics are not known. Computationally, our random search algorithm is at least 15 times more efficient than the fastest competing model-free methods on these benchmarks. We take advantage of this computational efficiency to evaluate the performance of our method over hundreds of random seeds and many different hyperparameter configurations for each benchmark task. Our simulations highlight a high variability in performance in these benchmark tasks, suggesting that commonly used estimations of sample efficiency do not adequately evaluate the performance of RL algorithms.},

abstract = {IEEE In this paper, a method is presented for lowering the energy consumption and/or increasing the speed of a standard manipulator spray painting a surface. The approach is based on the observation that a small angle between the spray direction and the surface normal does not affect the quality of the paint job. Recent results in set-based kinematic control are utilized to develop a switched control system, where this angle is defined as a set-based task with a maximum allowed limit. Four different set-based methods are implemented and tested on a UR5 manipulator from Universal Robots. Experimental results verify the correctness of the method, and demonstrate that the set-based approaches can substantially lower the paint time and energy consumption compared to the current standard solution.},

abstract = {This paper presents an autonomous motion planning algorithm for unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) to navigate safely in dynamic, cluttered environments. The algorithm not only addresses hazard avoidance (HA) for stationary and moving hazards, but also applies the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (known as COLREGS, for COLlision REGulationS). The COLREGS rules specify, for example, which vessel is responsible for giving way to the other and to which side of the 'stand-on' vessel to maneuver. Three primary COLREGS rules are considered in this paper: crossing, overtaking, and head-on situations. For autonomous USVs to be safely deployed in environments with other traffic boats, it is imperative that the USV's navigation algorithm obeys COLREGS. Furthermore, when other boats disregard their responsibility under COLREGS, the USV must fall back to its HA algorithms to prevent a collision. The proposed approach is based on velocity obstacles (VO) method, which generates a cone-shaped obstacle in the velocity space. Because VOs also specify on which side of the obstacle the vehicle will pass during the avoidance maneuver, COLREGS are encoded in the velocity space in a natural way. Results from several experiments involving up to four vessels are presented, in what we believe is the first on-water demonstration of autonomous COLREGS maneuvers without explicit intervehicle communication. We also show an application of this motion planner to a target trailing task, where a strategic planner commands USV waypoints based on high-level objectives, and the local motion planner ensures hazard avoidance and compliance with COLREGS during a traverse. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {— A cornerstone ability of an autonomous unmanned surface vessel (USV) is to avoid collisions with stationary obstacles and other moving vehicles while following a predefined path. USVs are typically underactuated, and this paper extends recent results in set-based guidance theory to an underactuated surface vessel, resulting in a switched guidance system with a path following mode and a collision avoidance mode. This system can be used with any combination of path following and collision avoidance guidance laws. Furthermore, a specific guidance law for collision avoidance is suggested that ensures tracking of a safe radius about a moving obstacle. The guidance law is specifically designed to assure collision avoidance while abiding by the International Regulations for Preventing Colli-sions at Sea (COLREGs). It is proven that the USV successfully circumvents the obstacles in a COLREGs compliant manner and that path following is achieved in path following mode. Simulations results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

abstract = {Modern computers separate computation and memory. Computation is performed by a processor, which can use an addressable memory to bring operands in and out of play. This confers two important benefits: the use of extensible storage to write new information and the ability to treat the contents of memory as variables. Variables are critical to algorithm generality: to perform the same procedure on one datum or another, an algorithm merely has to change the address it reads from. In contrast to computers, the computational and memory resources of artificial neural networks are mixed together in the network weights and neuron activity. This is a major liability: as the memory demands of a task increase, these networks cannot allocate new storage dynam-ically, nor easily learn algorithms that act independently of the values realized by the task variables. Although recent breakthroughs demonstrate that neural networks are remarkably adept at sensory processing 1 , sequence learning 2,3 and reinforcement learning 4 , cognitive scientists and neuroscientists have argued that neural networks are limited in their ability to represent variables and data structures 5–9 , and to store data over long timescales without interference 10,11 . We aim to combine the advantages of neu-ral and computational processing by providing a neural network with read–write access to external memory. The access is narrowly focused, minimizing interference among memoranda and enabling long-term storage 12,13 . The whole system is differentiable, and can therefore be trained end-to-end with gradient descent, allowing the network to learn how to operate and organize the memory in a goal-directed manner.},

abstract = {Deep artificial neural networks (DNNs) are typically trained via gradient-based learning algorithms, namely backpropagation. Evolution strategies (ES) can rival backprop-based algorithms such as Q-learning and policy gradients on challenging deep reinforcement learning (RL) problems. However, ES can be considered a gradient-based algorithm because it performs stochastic gradient descent via an operation similar to a finite-difference approximation of the gradient. That raises the question of whether non-gradient-based evolutionary algorithms can work at DNN scales. Here we demonstrate they can: we evolve the weights of a DNN with a simple, gradient-free, population-based genetic algorithm (GA) and it performs well on hard deep RL problems, including Atari and humanoid locomotion. The Deep GA successfully evolves networks with over four million free parameters, the largest neural networks ever evolved with a traditional evolutionary algorithm. These results (1) expand our sense of the scale at which GAs can operate, (2) suggest intriguingly that in some cases following the gradient is not the best choice for optimizing performance, and (3) make immediately available the multitude of neuroevolution techniques that improve performance. We demonstrate the latter by showing that combining DNNs with novelty search, which encourages exploration on tasks with deceptive or sparse reward functions, can solve a high-dimensional problem on which reward-maximizing algorithms (e.g.$\backslash$ DQN, A3C, ES, and the GA) fail. Additionally, the Deep GA is faster than ES, A3C, and DQN (it can train Atari in {\$}{\{}\backslashraise.17ex\backslashhbox{\{}{\$}$\backslash$scriptstyle$\backslash$sim{\$}{\}}{\}}{\$}4 hours on one desktop or {\$}{\{}\backslashraise.17ex\backslashhbox{\{}{\$}$\backslash$scriptstyle$\backslash$sim{\$}{\}}{\}}{\$}1 hour distributed on 720 cores), and enables a state-of-the-art, up to 10,000-fold compact encoding technique.},

We have many many documents (say n documents) and we want to find the ones that are close. But we don't want to calculate n 2 ≈ n 2 /2 distances to determine which ones are really similar. In particular, consider we have n = 1,000,000 items and we want to ask two questions: (Q1): Which items are similar? (Q2): Given a query item, which others are similar to the query? For (Q1) we don't want to check all roughly n 2 distance (no matter how fast each computation is), and for (Q2) we don't want to check all n items. In both cases we somehow want to figure out which ones might be close and the check those. Consider n points in the plane R 2 . How can we quickly answer these questions: • Hierarchical models (range trees, kd-trees, B-trees) don't work well in high dimensions. We will return to these in L8. • Lay down a Grid: Close points should be in same grid cell. But some can always lay across the boundary (no matter how close). Some may be further than 1 grid cell, but still close. And in high dimensions, the number of neighboring grid cells grows exponentially. One option is to randomly shift (and rotate) and try again.},

abstract = {Hashing has recently attracted considerable attention for large scale similarity search. However, learning compact codes with good performance is still a challenge. In many cases, the real-world data lies on a low-dimensional manifold embedded in high-dimensional ambient space. To capture meaningful neighbors, a compact hashing representation should be able to uncover the intrinsic geometric structure of the manifold, e.g., the neighborhood relationships between subregions. Most existing hashing methods only consider this issue during mapping data points into certain projected dimensions. When getting the binary codes, they either directly quantize the projected values with a threshold, or use an orthogonal matrix to refine the initial projection matrix, which both consider projection and quantization separately, and will not well preserve the locality structure in the whole learning process. In this paper, we propose a novel hashing algorithm called Locality Preserving Hashing to effectively solve the above problems. Specifically, we learn a set of locality preserving projections with a joint optimization framework, which minimizes the average projection distance and quantization loss simultaneously. Experimental comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods on two large scale datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.},

abstract = {—This paper describes a concept for a collision avoid-ance system for ships, based on model predictive control. A finite set of alternative control behaviors are generated by varying two parameters: offsets to the guidance course angle commanded to the autopilot, and changes to the propulsion command ranging from nominal speed to full reverse. Using simulated predictions of the trajectories of the obstacles and ship, the compliance with COLREGS and collision hazards associated with each of the alternative control behaviors are evaluated on a finite prediction horizon, and the optimal control behavior is selected. Robustness to sensing error, predicted obstacle behavior, and environmental conditions can be ensured by evaluating multiple scenarios for each control behavior. The method is conceptually and computationally simple and yet quite versatile as it can account for the dynamics of the ship, the dynamics of the steering and propulsion system, forces due to wind and ocean current, and any number of obstacles. Simulations show that the method is effective and can manage complex scenarios with multiple dynamic obstacles and uncertainty associated with sensors and predictions.},
