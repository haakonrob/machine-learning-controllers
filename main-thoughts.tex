The project has the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Perform a literature review on the topic of marine surface
  vessel modeling and control, as well as deep learning techniques
  used in tandem with control problems.
\item Set up a simulation environment for the surface vessel,
  incorporating difference levels of disturbances.
\item Set up a baseline using the established control algorithms
\item Apply reinforcement learning to the system and figure out how to
  train the system effectively.
\item Analyse the performance of the machine learning controllers,
  compare the computation time (the expensiveness) between the two
  algorithms, and explore the stability consequences of using machine
  learning techniques in control.
\end{enumerate}
