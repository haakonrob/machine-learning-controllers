\section{Problem Formulation}

In a navigation problem, one generally has a destination that you wish
to get your system to. If the environement is deterministic, using
some kind of path planning method like A* works well, as long as the
``obstacles'' are known. When the environement is dynamic and unknown,
this is not as easy. The ``global'' path may still be there, but there
might be many small local obstacles that need to be avoided. A local
avoidance system is therefore needed.

Potential fields might lead to oscillatory behaviour.

Dynamic window assume no sideways velocity, which is difficult in the
context of ocean currents. Also computationally heavy, but works well
with COLREGS.

The project has the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Perform a literature review on the topic of marine surface
  vessel modeling and control, as well as deep learning techniques
  used in tandem with control problems.
\item Set up a simulation environment for the surface vessel,
  incorporating difference levels of disturbances.
\item Set up a baseline using the established control algorithms
\item Apply reinforcement learning to the system and figure out how to
  train the system effectively.
\item Analyse the performance of the machine learning controllers,
  compare the computation time (the expensiveness) between the two
  algorithms, and explore the stability consequences of using machine
  learning techniques in control.  machine learning
