\section{Problem Formulation}


The project has the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Perform a literature review on the topic of marine surface
  vessel modeling and control, as well as deep learning techniques
  used in tandem with control problems.
\item Set up a simulation environment for the surface vessel,
  incorporating difference levels of disturbances.
\item Set up a baseline using the established control algortihms
\item Apply machine learning (behavioural cloning or reinforcement
  learning) and compare them to the baseline
\item Analyse the performance of the machine learning controlelrs,
  compare the computation time (the expensiveness) between the two
  algrothms, and explore the stability consequences of using machine
  learning techniqes in control.  machine learning
\end{enumerate]
